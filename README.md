# liver-disease-prediction

## Machine Learning to predict whether a given patient has a liver disease or not.

## SupportVectorClassification, Logistic Regression and RandomForestClassification

**The dataset (which has been posted on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/indian-liver-patient-records)) has been taken from [UCI Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/indian-liver-patient-records).**

## Description

Patients with Liver disease have been continuously increasing because of excessive consumption of alcohol, inhale of harmful gases, intake of contaminated food, pickles and drugs. This dataset was used to evaluate prediction algorithms in an effort to reduce burden on doctors.

Columns:

    Age of the patient
    Gender of the patient
    Total Bilirubin
    Direct Bilirubin
    Alkaline Phosphotase
    Alamine Aminotransferase
    Aspartate Aminotransferase
    Total Protiens
    Albumin
    Albumin and Globulin Ratio
    Dataset: field used to split the data into two sets (patient with liver disease, or no disease)
